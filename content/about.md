  heading: Our Mission
  description: >-
    AGIR’s mission is to protect and defend the legal, social, and economic
    rights of migrants (asylum seekers, refugees, immigrants, and those with
    undetermined status) from lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and queer (LGBTQ+)
    communities.


    To accomplish our mission, we develop and offer services, information, programs and resources to LGBTQ+ migrants and other organizations that support our community. We work hand-in-hand with concerned individuals, and with lawyers, psychologists, social workers, community workers and actors in various levels of government, both federal and provincial authorities in the fields of immigration, refugee status and citizenship.
